1. It would print out the original array because the uniq method didn't have the bang

2. The "bang" or "!" operator usually makes the method being called mutate the object that it was called on. 
	The question mark usually makes the expression conditional, yielding a true or a fales
		1. This means "not equal to", and is used in conditional control/loops
		2. This means a boolean "NOT" which negates the logical value
		3. Mutates the object that the method is being called on
		4. Ternary operator
		5. Makes this a logical test, returns boolean value
		6. Turns object into boolean equivalent

3. advice ["important"] = "urgent"

4. the first one would return [1,3,4,5], the second one would return [2,3,4,5]

5. (10...100).include?(42)

6. Just adding the two : famous_words = famous_words + "Four score and "
		Next, using interpolation: famous_words = "Four score and #{famous_words}"

7. "number" is seeded with the integer 2. "add_eight" is called five times, so the answer would be 42

8. flintstones.flatten!

9. flintstones.assoc('Barney')

10. flintstones.each_with_index {|name, index| new_hash[name] = index}
	Don't forget to initiliaze prior: new_hash = {}

1. I would have expected it to throw an error, but that's an interesting behavior. Probably not the best practice to not have that more tightly controlled, though. 

2. Also unexpected, but the nuance here again is whether the methods act on the objects themselves or on a new object. 

3. A, B output as expected. C is different because gsub sees that the strings are unchanged and keeps the object association

4. see uuid_generator.rb

5. see monkey_patch.rb 

6. Need to add a couple things: 

	variable like "count" that's initialized to 0, then incremented each time a valid number is found. Add if statement and return false if count < 4 at the end of the method. 

	change the if statement from break. If it's not a valid number, you can return false right then and skip the rest of the execution

	bonus: also return false if the number is greater than 255... (invalid IP)
